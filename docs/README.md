Hello to anyone who stumbles across my little project!
I'm a Battletech loving data analyst who's currently on the job hunt and have decided to apply my skills to the master unit list with my free time!

I want to know whether the differences between factions can be encapsulated in the tonnage and roles of their faction-specific mechs
in the master unit list. My aim is to make some visualizations as a game aid to help new players get a flavour for each major house's 
mech lineup in the war-ravaged lostech era.
